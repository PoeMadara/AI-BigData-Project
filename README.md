# AI-BigData-Project

### Project on Training Program for Artificial Intelligence and Big Data Programming Applicable in 5G Environments

I started this project in early July 2024. Currently, the project is in a very early phase, so please ignore the "Class tasks" folders.

I am working on this project solo, and I am focused on developing and exploring various aspects of AI and Big Data technologies in the context of 5G environments.

If you have any suggestions or would like to discuss the project, feel free to contact me at: carlos.poemadara@gmail.com

## Chatbot Implementations

As part of the project, I have developed two simple chatbot implementations to illustrate different levels of chatbot complexity. Below are details of each implementation:

### Level 0: Basic Rule-Based Chatbot

**Description**: This chatbot uses a set of predefined rules and keywords to generate responses. It does not use machine learning or advanced language processing techniques. Instead, it matches user inputs against a fixed list of keywords and provides responses based on these keywords.

**Key Features**:
- Responds to a fixed set of keywords with predefined answers.
- No learning or adaptation capabilities.
- Suitable for simple interactions and predefined responses.

**Usage**:
- Run the script to start the chatbot.
- Type in simple queries or greetings to receive responses based on predefined keywords.
- To stop the chatbot, type 'exit', 'quit', or 'stop'.

**Code**:

### Level 1: Pattern-Based Chatbot

**Description**: This chatbot uses pattern matching and regular expressions to understand and respond to user inputs. It is more advanced than the Level 0 chatbot but still does not incorporate machine learning. It can handle a broader range of inputs and provide contextually relevant responses based on defined patterns.

**Key Features**:
- Uses patterns and regular expressions for interpreting user inputs.
- Can handle a wider variety of inputs compared to Level 0 chatbots.
- Still operates within a fixed set of rules without learning capabilities.

**Usage**:
- Run the script to start the chatbot.
- Use various phrases and keywords to interact with the bot. It will respond based on the patterns defined in the script.
- To stop the chatbot, type 'exit', 'quit', or 'stop'.

**Code**:

## Future Developments

I am currently working on evolving these chatbots into more advanced AI systems. The goal is to incorporate machine learning and other advanced techniques to enhance their capabilities and adaptability. Stay tuned for future updates as the project progresses!
